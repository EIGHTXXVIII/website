            Kim'Yani Professional Services</a> A brand-new, expertly-designed logo that will undoubtedly catch people's
            attention! This is the type of logo design Kim'Yani Professional Services, LLC is aiming for. Kim'Yani
            Professional Services LLC, based in Bowie, Maryland, services clients
            throughout the United States. Their primary concentration is on notary public services and HR consulting. A
            mutual acquaintance suggested EIGHTXXVVIII (8:28) to Kim'Yani Professional Services LLC.
            <br><br>
          </p>

          <p>
            We devised a solution after examining the client's needs and objectives. To create a new handwritten logo that is elegant and easy to read. Redesigning their brand logo might demonstrate that the firm is expanding and distinguishing itself from competition. The newly revised Kim'Yani Professional Services logo aims for a clean and modern look that is simple yet sophisticated while preserving the professional look that is suitable for the company.<br /><br />
          </p>

          <ul role="list" class="p">
            <li>We used a logo with a simple but effective character that can be seen on a small screen.</li>
            <li>The hand signature is highlighted to make the notary stand out. The freehand lettering on the logo reflects the company's strong character and strong brand awareness.</li>
            <li>The color desired by the customer is black and white. This color scheme is perfect for conveying a clear distinction.</li>
            <li>In order to emphasize the notarial aspect of the company, the logo features fonts in both a script and serif style. The typefaces have a handwritten quality, which lends an air of sophistication and encourages creative thinking.</li><br /><br />
          </ul>

          <p>
            We used our creativity and experience to realize the goal of Kim'Yani Professional Services LLC. We pay a lot of attention to create a logo that is suitable for the company and attractive to potential customers.<br /><br />
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>"...professionalism is unmatched. We have received SO many compliments on the new logo. We are EXTREMELY happy with the outcome..."</i> said <b>Kimberly D. Johnson, Co-Founder and CFO of Kim'Yani Professional Services.</b><br /><br />
