            <small>Story:</small><br>This is a journey of how the COVID-19 setback allowed a window of opportunity for
            self-employment and job security in this digital world. <a href="https://mjmbookkeepingservices.com"
              target="_blank">MJM Booking Services</a> had
            approached us in 2020 and we began the wonderful journey of creating a lasting brand and website that
            reflects the heart and soul of the business. Without any prior online presence, we were mindful that the
            fast-paced and crowded digital world meant that the design elements needed to be distinctive to draw the
            immediate attention of the audience. The branding of MJM Booking Services needed to be a point of difference
            while staying true to its purpose. We had to also align our passion and creativity with the goal that this
            business needed a good head start. The composition of the logo is a correlation of vibrant, meaningful
            typography and a mesh of elements combined together, have its own story to tell.<br /><br />
          </p>
          
          <p style="padding-left:20px">
            <span style="color:#FAE345">&#10011; </span>The surrounding “M”s in MJM represents Ownership.<br />
            <span style="color:#FAE345">&#10011; </span> The shadowed equal sign "=" is a visual representation of the
            physical service it provides.<br />
            <span style="color:#FAE345">&#10011; </span> In the middle is a “J” which represents the heart of the
            business - an overarching symbol like an umbrella to show protection and widespread opportunities of
            coverage in the area of bookkeeping.<br />
            <span style="color:#FAE345">&#10011; </span> The choice of a vibrant bold blue exhibits a strong assurance
            of duty in the field of Accounting.<br />
            <span style="color:#FAE345">&#10011; </span> The lime yellow brings a refreshing sight while blending well
            with the other elements.<br />
            <span style="color:#FAE345">&#10011; </span> The white background is set behind the main content to keep the
            corporate style and for the audience to consume the content with ease.<br />
            <span style="color:#FAE345">&#10011; </span> Typography, Sora & Source Sans were our choices for they pair
            well together. Interestingly, Sora in Japanese meaning sky was a perfect trope to subtly embed a scene for
            this business beginning a new venture.<br /><br />
          </p>

          <p>
            All these elements are carefully crafted and ordered to ensure that it stands out, and the
            business can be easily found by those that need their services. For the owners, the strong brand standpoint, gives
            them a peace of mind and a less arduous journey online. <mark>Like any great story with a lifeline, this business
            logo and website is a great testament that the journey of design is so critical.</mark> When done right, can have a
            strong digital presence which can make all the difference!<br /><br />
